# Architecture

I have decided to completely separate the front-end from the back-end.
This allows for better separation in terms of teams and tech stack in the future. (Assuming the API doesnt change ofc).

# Improvements

## Notifications
The notifications UX are not what I would use in production.
I would probably use a pop-up modal instead or have a dedicated section to it.
I just wanted to show that I know you need to ask for permissions in terms of notifications (firefox for example no longer allows you to just ask for permissions unless its a response to a user action).

## UI/UX and mobile support
This one is self explanatory.
I am not a very good designer. I can more easily iterate design wise based on
some wireframes than doing something from scratch.
I also would have liked to add mobile support which is also linked with above.

## CPU Load Average
This is a new field fo me and I merely used the provided solution.
I searched for a lot of alternatives on gitub/gist/stackoverflow but I still don't understand what all the values mean and how to exactly get the proper avg %.
